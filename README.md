# My Portfolio
Here is my portfolio site's code. I've build this site with the intent to showcase my works and skill set, for anyone interested in. Originally was created with plain JavaScript, but  I remake it with Angular 2/4. *(in future with React and/or Vue).*

## Plain JavaScript
My initial intent was to make a site that was created by the basic building blocks. Single page application with scrolling effect, for looking the content.

## Angular 2/4
Recreated the initial application with Angular 2/4. *(Work in progress...)*

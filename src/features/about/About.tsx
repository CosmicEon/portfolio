              Hello, my name is Krasen Ilkov, I'm {myAge} years old Web
              Developer. I love computer technologies and everything that brings
              with them. I work with JavaScript both in front-end with libraries
              and frameworks like Angular 2, and I work on back-end with Express
              framework. I like to stay up-to-date with the new technology and
              to experiment with them to uderstarnd how they work and how can
              improve my workflow.

            <p>
              It's needed knowledge about technology, proper application of it
              and dedication to make an idea come true. I know some technologies
              well and for others have some basic knowledge about them, but my
              willingness to learn gives me the opportunity to improve my
              skills.
